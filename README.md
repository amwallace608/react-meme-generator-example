This is a bare-bones meme generator web application created in the process of learning the basics of the React JS framework. 
It displays user input for the top and bottom text fields of randomly selected meme images retrieved from the Imgflip API (https://api.imgflip.com/). 

Developed with Visual Studio Code and https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.
